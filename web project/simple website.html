            <h2>Bachelor of Education (Honours) in Primary Education Degree Program</h2>
            <p> The Department of Early Childhood and Primary Education of the Faculty of Education, 
                Open University of Sri Lanka has been conducting the Bachelor of Education (Hons) in Primary Education Programme since 2019.

                The main purposes of this programme are to provide opportunities to enhance knowledge and skills in Early Childhood and Primary
                 Education fields, to open avenues to get higher qualifications and professional training to those who are engaged in teaching 
                 at Early Childhood and Primary Levels, and also to expand opportunities for students who have G.C.E (Advanced Level) 
                 qualifications and who have missed the opportunities to enter any other state university.
                
                Having considered the above requirements, the Department of Early Childhood and Primary Education has decided to introduce 
                Bachelor of Education (Honours) in Primary Education Programme.</p>
