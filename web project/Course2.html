         <p>The Department of Early Childhood and Primary Education of the Faculty of Education, Open University of Sri Lanka
             has been conducting the Bachelor of Education (Hons) in Primary Education Programme since 2019.

            The main purposes of this programme are to provide opportunities to enhance knowledge and skills in Early Childhood and
             Primary Education fields, to open avenues to get higher qualifications and professional training to those who are engaged in
              teaching at Early Childhood and Primary Levels, and also to expand opportunities for students who have G.C.E (Advanced Level) 
              qualifications and who have missed the opportunities to enter any other state university.
            
            Having considered the above requirements, the Department of Early Childhood and Primary Education has decided to introduce
             Bachelor of Education (Honours) in Primary Education Programme.!</p>
